Hunger
Starting to get hungry
Feeling light-headed now


Thirst
My throat's feeling dry
Need to drink something soon

Toilet
Can't hold it in much longer
Bathroom... where is the bathroom

Sanity
Think I just heard something
I feel something behind me
Could've sworn I saw something
Stop chasing me
Leave me alone
